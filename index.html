                  Have you ever wanted to have the ability to move things with your mind? Unfortunately, telekinesis is still only a theory and has not yet
                  and may never be proven. With the help of Emotiv and Arduino, my project will take us that step further!<br />
                  Using a brain to computer interface and a car from a simple arduino kit and parralax created a mind controlled wheel chair prototype.

                  This project was for my thesis in my Ô¨Ånal
                  year of college. I chose it because i
                  found the topic massively interesting
                  and found it would be a good project to
                  do due to the area of Brain Computer
                  interfaces to be quite experimental at
                  this present time. <br />
                  This project was created with the help
                  of an Emotiv Epoc Headset, two of their
                  free software packages

                  Processing, Arduino, and a
                  Parrallax Board of Education Bot.
                  In order to do this i trained my thoughts
                  with the Emotiv Epoc Headset and the
                  software Xavier Control Panel. The
                  electrical currents from beneath the
                  scalp read by the sensors on the
                  headset was then converted to an
                  OpenSound Controlled (OSC)

                  After that the Processsing translated the
                  OSC message to a value and sent
                  across a serial portal to the sketch made
                  with Arduino.
                  I then implemented the Arduino board
                  to turn left and right depending on the
                  OSC message sent across from the
                  headset.

                  During the summer of 2016, I left my part time job and set up shop with an internship in a small Irish
                  company on the southside of Dublin City. They specialised in creating software named GoodMove, to manage
                  small business like themselves when it came to appointments, invoicing and awaiting payments. Most of
                  their business lay with companies that dealt with customers in person such as KN install solutions
                  and Gas Services Limited.

                  With technology progressing they found
                  it was time to upgrade their software and add new features. My job there was to create an android Remote application
                  that communicated to and from the software of each company. This was not only good for the environment,
                  helping ditch docket books, but it also helped prevent mistakes and show how or when they happened with
                  time stamp and signatures. The system was implemented with security checks

                  Unfortunately, as i was only in my 3rd of 4 years in college, when the summer came to  an end i was unable
                  to continue my work with that project. This however was one of my favourite projects to have taken on since
                  i started my journey in college because it was all self taught and showed me what i was capable of when i
                  put my mind to something.
