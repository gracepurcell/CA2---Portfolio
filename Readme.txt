Hi John,

So i couldn't manage to figure out the live annotations to sit over divs and images
without usiing position absolute. When the screen gets smaller than 1900 width then 
the svg lines wont line up with the pic or the divs on the day by day mock up or 
warmhome mockup.
When opening mobile could you use the iPhone6(375 x 667) template please because otherwise 
the same thing will happen with those svgs. Oh and open with chrome because 
apparently in ff they dont match inline either :( 

Thank you for allowing me the extra time if i needed it. 

Grace :)
